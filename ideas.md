### Short story about cartographers
Cartographers are tired of having to worry about border disputes, so they start their own militia to settle them once and for all. Make the territory the map.

### Failed artist
Programming in a really well engineered environment can feel like this: https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/jerry-saltz-my-life-as-a-failed-artist.html . You are so literate in this world that no one else is prepared to understand.


### Simulate data consistent with paper
Example: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24366006

frustrating that we don't have row level data (anonymity?)

if you didn't want us doing this, publish the data

Include correlations (including on unmeasured things?) that would hamper things.

### Shamemap
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23424116 Consider a texture map just like, a precomputed data cache. You can encode pretty much anything in them. Why, in the gritty gore and carrion filled trenches, I've created systems where artists can use maps to annotate parts of models they think suck. That map was used in a camera AI system that tried to avoid looking at parts artists are ashamed of, adjust depth of field threshholds depending on the depth of bad stuff... That kind of thing. (That texture seam is too gross for the sizzle cinematic, there's NO TIME to fix it. Just smudge the camera, or have it lose focus as it sweeps through! shameMap.png to the rescue).
