## Induction Heads

I was recently working on a project to try to understand how induction heads form in transformers. This is almost entirely derived from the work in [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) and its sequel [In-context Learning and Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html).
