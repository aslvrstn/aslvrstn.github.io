title: "Stuff I Like"
---

Stuff I Like is very important to me! By Stuff I mostly mean media. I also like a great deal of non-media things, but I'll list those elsewhere. It sounds maybe redundant to say that Stuff I Like is important to me, but I mean a little more than "this stuff is enjoyable to me." Consuming and discussing Stuff with friends is a big part of how I connect. So basically this is a giant list of stuff that I Like (usually Love) that I would be thrilled to talk with you about basically anytime.

My rule of thumb for this is that I better have engaged with this thing for more than four hours. Movies need to be rewatchable, YouTube videos need to be _really_ rewatchable, and short stories need to be revisited, but books might only get a single read-through.

This is a massive WIP right now, so I recognize that it appears slightly deranged and is basically what came to mind during a particularly weird ten minutes.

  - Video essays ostensibly (ok, and actually) about video games that end up analyzing the human condition in actually moving ways. I have teared up during a review of (which one??)

  - Just a perfect sendup of elementary school edutainment games among other references.
