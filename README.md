## How this blog works, so I remember in the future

It's all Hugo

LaTeX rendering: Uses KaTeX, instructions followed: https://mertbakir.gitlab.io/hugo/math-typesetting-in-hugo/

Deploys: Uses the built-in github runner for GitHub Pages at https://github.com/aslvrstn/aslvrstn.github.io/settings/pages
